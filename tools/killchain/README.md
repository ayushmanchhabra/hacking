# killchain

Multithreaded network scanner that crafts raw IP/TCP packets by hand — no libpcap, no wrappers.

Supports SYN port scanning and ICMP host discovery across single hosts and subnets, hardened with clang-tidy, Valgrind, and AddressSanitizer.

## Getting Started

> Note: Linux environment is required. This does not work on Windows since raw sockets have been heavily restricted since Windows XP SP2 (2004). MacOS and Android support is possible (PR is welcome).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ayushmanchhabra/killchain
cd killchain
sudo apt install clang clang-format clang-tidy valgrind
```

## Usage

```shell
# Compile binary
└─$ make

# API
└─$ sudo ./out/bin/killchain
Usage: killchain <IP|CIDR> <-|out.csv|out.json|out.xml>

└─$ sudo ./out/bin/killchain 8.8.8.8 -

3 open port(s) found.

```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Subnet host check with `S. No` and `use 4` like in Metasploit
- [ ] Complete TCP handshake to get service info on specific ports (`nmap -sCV` ...)
- [ ] Auto search for vulnerabilities using NIST, Shodan, etc based on service info (integrate with searchsploit and metasploit)
- [ ] If single IP, pull IPDR information
- [ ] Capture MAC addresses on network if TCP handshake is completed
